      <h3>Reasons For Applying</h3>
      <p><u>Note from Bradley:</u><br><br><br>

"The Founders & Coders application asks why I'd like to be a software developer.<br><br>

The short answer is that I think I have quite a bit to offer the field. I'm patient, tenacious, analytical. I love problem-solving. In my previous professional life as an academic, editor, and translator I developed deep client-orientated listening skills and attention to detail. I have often delivered in high stress situations under tight deadlines. I'm very curious and always open to learning new things.<br><br>

I have demonstrated that I am a quick learner of languages (human languages at least), and enjoy challenges.<br><br>

I have a proven track record in valuing social justice projects, with a focus on migration and medical care. In future I would like to focus on how I can help communities who do not necessarily trust tech to access medical care and other basic services within their communities.<br><br>

I had the opportunity to work with the F&C team as a Product Owner in 2018. I have experienced firsthand the drive, optimism and commitment that the people at F&C offer. The developers I know who have graduated from the programme call F&C "life-changing". There are many bootcamps out there, but it's F&C people that make the difference. That has been my experience as a PO, and I'd like it to be my experience as a student.<br><br>

I am currently in professional transition. I've taken a "family break" of five years, during which time I've mostly been a mum.  Now that my son is at school, I'm excited to move on to new horizons. I would be over the moon if that new horizon were at Founders and Coders.<br><br>

Kind Regards,<br><br>

  Bradley."<br>

      <h3>Biography</h3>
      <p>{text in <strong>bold</strong> relates to photos in the slideshow.}<br><br><br>

        Bradley was born an American citizen and was <strong>raised in the Middle East</strong> for the first few years of her life, including near <strong>where F&C's Gaza Sky Geeks are currently located.</strong> As such she has had a lifelong interest in other cultures and languages.<br><br>

        During most of her childhood she <strong>lived in Colorado.</strong> As a "Xennial", or someone that was born to an analogue world but raised digital, Bradley has fond memories of playing <strong>text-based first-person adventure games</strong> (especially Roberta Williams' groundbreaking King's Quest I-IV) on floppy disk, and teaching her parents commands in MS-DOS. This is somewhat ironic because Bradley now spends lots of hours typing commands into JavaScript.<br><br>

        In 2005 she <strong>moved to Italy.</strong> Although she didn't speak Italian at all at that time, she learned the language well enough to get accepted to a Bachelor's programme in 2007. She graduated with an Italian BA in Economic Development in 2010, and an MA in International Relations in 2016. Bradley also <strong>lectured in the Medical Department at her university in Rome,</strong> and it was during this time that she started doing medical translation for refugee communities during the migrant crisis. This became her academic research interest; a <strong>dissertation on which she successfully defended in 2016.</strong><br><br>

        While in Italy Bradley also competed in Track and Field for ten years, <strong>specialising in pole vault.</strong> Through this experience Bradley developed tenacity, consistency, resilience, humility and teamwork while strengthening her skills over a number of years.<br><br>

        Career-wise, Bradley taught technical English and completed technical translations (medical, law, architecture, engineering) from Italian to English for over ten years. This work involved developing strong listening skills, learning quickly, attention to detail, a client-focussed approach, managing expectations and delivering at pace.<br><br>

        In 2016 Bradley immigrated to the United Kingdom after marrying, and in 2017 had <strong>a baby called Arthur.</strong> It soon became clear that her academic interest (language barriers in migrant health) would likely not be if interest to British universities, Bradley continued her work by founding a UK charity called <strong>Twig: The Medical Translation Database.</strong> The charity used Founders and Coders (GSG) to <strong>develop its project in 2018,</strong> and has continued to do so ever since. As a PO Bradley learned a lot about Agile product development, and product management. She especially enjoyed enjoyed presenting, creating user personas, and user testing.<br><br>

        Bradley received British citizenship in 2021.

      <h3>Application Project Links & Profile Information</h3>
      <u>Note from Bradley:</u> "I decided to apply for the F&C January cohort in mid September of 2021. I've had about three months to complete all of the required courses in CodeCamp, plus the F&C prompts/projects. I'm immensely proud of my progress, but to code I'm most comfortable with CodePen at the moment. I have followed the instructions (and used) Replit, StackBlitz, VSCode, and GitHub, but I'm not a pro. I've also used CodeSandbox to move all of my work to GitHub repositories. Should any of these projects <strong>not</strong> display correctly in other platforms, please see CodePen, where all of my projects are available and everything runs/displays smoothly. The dates in CodePen are easier to follow, and show my progress over the months."<br><br><br>
